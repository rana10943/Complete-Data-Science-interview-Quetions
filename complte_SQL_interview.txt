Q. write a query to retrieve data from two related tables using an Inner join

#employe # doctors
select emp_name,emp.city,doctors.city,doc_name,specialization 
from employee
inner join doctors
on emp.position_code = doctor.postion_code;

Q. How do you filter using where clause 
select emp_name from employee
where emp_id = 1001


DDL - Data Definiation Language
# create - crete database, create table 
# alter - modify existing database object, such as table
# drop - delete entire table or view of table or other objects in  database


create database medgini;

create table employees (
emp_id primary key auto_icrement,
emp_name varchar(255),
department archar(55),
hire_date date,
salary decimal(10,2)
);

# insert values 
insert into employees (emp_id,emp_name,department,hire_date,salary)
values
(1,'subodhrana',it,'2022-10-10',25000.00)

# alter-modify existing table or oject
alter table employees
add column email varchar(255);

#change data type of salary
alter table employees
alter column salary decimal(12,2);

#add primary key
alter table employees
add primary key (emp_id);


##########DROP Command$######

Q. Remove column
alter table employees
drop column position;

Q. Modify column name
alter table employees
rename column department to Dept; (changes dapartment to dept)

# add foriegn key constraints
- add foregin key constaints on 'department-id' refrencing department table

alter table employees
add constraints fk_department
foregin key (department_id)
refrences depertments(depatment_id);


# add deafult values

alter table employees
alter column salary set default 25000.00;


# remove default values

alter table employees
alter column salary drop default;


# add unique constraints
alter table employees
add constraints unique_email unique(email);


#drop primary key
alter table emploee
drop constraint employee_pkey;





#--------------- DROP COMMAND--------------

DROP command used for reove table , indexes, constraints
 or other object present in the data base

# drp a table
Drop table emploees;

#Drop column
alter table employees
drop column salary;


#drop index
drop index idx_department;

#drop primary constraints
alter table employees
drop constraints employess_pkey;

#drop a unique constraints
alter table employees
drop contraints unique_emil;

# drop froign key
alter table employees
drop constraint fk_departments;

# drop databases
drop database medgini

#Drop a view
drop view employee_view;

# drop trigger
drop trigger trigger_name on employyes;


#--------------what is view ----------------#
view is nothing but it is virtual table that is based on the resut 
of select query
-->it does not store data but provides way to present the data
store one or more table


Q2. why would use a view?
view basically use for reduce complexity and simflify queery
and provide additional layer of security
 
Q3. How do you create a view?

crate view view_name AS
select column1, column2,.....
from table_name
where condition;

create view employee_view as
select emp_name, state
from employee
where emp_id = 10

Q4. can you update data through a view?
yes but based on single table not all database but some database they allow

Q5. How do you drop a view?

drop view employee_view;

Q6 Difference between view and table?
table - physical storage structure that hold data
view- view is a virtual table doesnt store any data


Q7. can a view join multiple tables?
yes- view cam join multiple table using the **JOIN clause**
resulting query may be view only no any kind of editable 



#----------Aggreagte function in SQL-------------#

is nothing but provide single value summarizations
1.count
slect count(emp_name) from employee
where state = 'chhatisgarh';

2.sum
select sum(invoice_amount) from employee
where state = 'Telangana';

3.AVG
select avg(chemist_active) from employee

4.Min 
5.Max

6.Group concat
- concatenate values from multiple rows into single string

select group_concat(first_name,middle_name,last_name,pin_code) from employee
where state = 'Jharkhand'
group by state;

8. Count distinct
select count(distinct emp_id) 
from employee;

2.insert
3.update
4.delete

#---------select cmd----
selct * from emplyees;

#----------insert command-------
Q.insert new employee into the 'employee' table
insert into employees(emp_name,emp_salary,department)
values('rana',60000,'IT')

#-----------Update cmd---------
Q. update the salry of emplyee in the 'IT' department
update employees
set emp_salary = emp_salry * 5%
where department = 'IT';


#---------------------- updte employee-----
Q. update 
update employees 
set emp_id =55
where emp_id=505;

Q.Update the salary of employee with id 101
update employees
set emp_salary = 25000
where emp_id = 101;


#----------Delete command-------------------
Q. Delte emloyees with a salry less than 30000

delete from employees
where salry <30000;

Q. delete comand with multiple conditions

delete from employees
where depatment = 'IT'
AND emp_salry <30000;



# subquerries and joins------

#--Subqueries
is also called nested query or inner query
is a query within another query in sql .

--> usually in the where or having clause

** the reult of the subquery is used by the main query to perform frther analysis

example:-
select column1, col2,..
from employees
where column_name operator (select column_name from another_able where condition);

# filtering data by using nested query

select employee_name,salary
from employees
where salary > (select avg(Salary) from emplyess);


# checking Existence
Q. use a subquery to check for the existence of a record 
in another table

select customer_name
from customers
where exists (select 1 from orders where customers.customer_id = orders.customers_id);


# calculations

select departments (select avg(salary) from employes
where employees.department_id = department.department_id)
as avg_salary
from departments

# in , ANY or all operator 
select product_name 
from products
where product_id in(slect product_id from order_items 
where quantity >10);


# order of sql query
1.from
2.where
3.group by
4.having
5.slect
6.distinct
7.order by
8.limit
